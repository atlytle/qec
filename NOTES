Settled on jupytext to help with versioning notebooks.
It creates a .py mirroring .ipynb w/out metadata etc.
The sync operation is configured in jupytext.toml,
and run at `git commit` via .git/hooks/pre-commit.
I hit snags storing .py in ./bck/ and .ipynb in root,
so storing everything in root for the time being.
